<p> Bubbles - small, big, colored thing,                                             </p>
<p> you blow them, they will fly, as if touch the sky.                               </p>
<p> ephemeral - never care - flaunt their wings,                                     </p>
<p> you will not know, it's a bubble thing!                                          </p>
<p>                                                                                  </p>
<p>                                                                                  </p>
<p> One day I asked a bubbly bubble,                                                 </p>
<p> you sway  as if you will always be there;                                        </p>
<p> oblivious of thing, you sway  in your own bubble.                                </p>
<p> she said - it's a bubble thing!                                                  </p>
<p>                                                                                  </p>
<p>                                                                                  </p>
<p> The bubble said where did you blow me from and where did I eventually go?        </p>
<p> I thought and thought...                                                         </p>
<p> She said why are you so attached to just one form of the duality,                </p>
<p> but may be its a little non-intuitive to you, as it's a bubble thing!            </p>
<p>                                                                                  </p>
<p>                                                                                  </p>
<p> She said - you thought you generated one, but it was always there!               </p>
<p> you just changed its form to something, which was volatile and bare.             </p>
<p> You behold the vista - but once you desired to hold...                           </p>
<p> But, why am I telling you this...? it's a bubble thing!                          </p>
