Bubbles - small, big, colored thing,
<br>
you blow them, they will fly, as if touch the sky.
<br>
ephemeral - never care - flaunt their wings,
<br>
you will not know, it's a bubble thing!
<br>
</p>
<p>
One day I asked a bubbly bubble,
<br>
you sway  as if you will always be there;
<br>
oblivious of thing, you sway  in your own bubble.
<br>
she said - it's a bubble thing!
</p>
<p>
The bubble said where did you blow me from and where did I eventually go?
<br>
I thought and thought...
<br>
She said why are you so attached to just one form of the duality,
<br>
but may be its a little non-intuitive to you, as it's a bubble thing!
<br>
</p>
<p>
She said - you thought you generated one, but it was always there!
<br>
you just changed its form to something, which was volatile and bare.
<br>
You behold the vista - but once you desired to hold...
<br>
But, why am I telling you this...? it's a bubble thing!
<br>
