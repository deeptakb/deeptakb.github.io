Life is as apparent as classical physics. But likewise, only the classical definition ceases to be valid at the meta-levels. The apprehension is the same, whether it is life or physics, to find out the fundamental thing. Every discovery we make is vulnerable although we clamor of its authenticity. There is apprehension, there is perfection but where is obscured our satisfaction. Differentiating life gives life itself, i.e., the smallest part of life has still got that property of wave function which uniquely defines it. Our degrees of freedom leads to our degrees of confinement. Confining ourselves under assumptions conceals the assumption.
</p>

<p>
Faith should be continuous if we talk in the realm of classical physics. But if it is so, why is it that our faith varies with persons. Eventually, we term our faith discrete, i.e. our deeply rooted conviction belong to the orbit of highest energy and similarly there are different orbits for our different perspectives. But still, we fear from the fragility of our ideologies, our theories, our principles, and very smartly we conceal it. How on earth are you going to justify it? 
</p>

<p>
Life being a dispersive media, the wave function of ours is bound to undergo distortion both in space and time which depends on space and time respectively. But still, the real wave function should remain intact otherwise the definition of the wave will change. Our wave function is our identity as it is a Fourier transform of all our attributes. Generalization, simplification, and alteration may modify the definition of your wave function. 
</p>

<p>
You have to follow the circuit mean for you because it is the property of current to pass through the path of minimum resistance but output can only be drawn from it if flows through a resistance. Basically, what is it that we carve for? What is our fundamental desire - our longings, whims, desires, or pride, virtue or ego. It turns a bit bizarre but being whimsical don't suffice because breaking rules for a selfish motive cannot be justified anyway. It is more of a physics that we can not understand our real structure if we are not in the ground, unbiased, uninfluenced state. But yeah, if you try to study a wave function, you will alter its wave function, i.e. At least for a human, it is impossible to determine what the other person sitting next to you is thinking. Rather it is prudent to know your wave function.

<p>
A particle (a) has a probability of being found anywhere in space, (b) has the energy of order E = mc^2. But can you realize it? It is an irony only that two most perennials sources of energy - our philosophers and nuclear fusion - remain mostly unused. Intricacies of life are hard to be understood. But still, we are lost in the exterior world oblivious of the ulterior realities. Out life has subdued us and we conceal our emotions considering them quixotic.
