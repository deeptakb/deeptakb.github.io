Karma is the action we do. But this is a little more subtle than that. Karma,
in some sense, implies the impressions or impact left on us after the actions. 
The impressions we are talking about are a result of the past action 
we have performed. In this article, we will discuss the karma
and how does it leaves us with heaps of impressions. We will then
look into its implication and possibly understand what should be done about it. 
</p>

<p>
It is the desire which drives us to perform a certain action. We need to dwell in a bit
further on this desire issue to get a more broader view on the things involved.
Desire is something that makes us do things, takes us to places and defines the
way we are to a large extent. I am not writing this post through some favorite
editor of mine but through the desire to write and communicate with others. So
desire seems like a nice thing. But why is it that our desires for things do not end?
And why does it lead to sufferings?
</p>

<p>
There are two important aspects to our desires - material and spiritual. 
It is the material desire which
will not satiate and hence we will keep pining for what is not!  This may steal
our 'inner peace' leading us to, erroneously, believe that all sorts of
sufferings find their seeds in desires. Then, one starts desiring that all
desires should go for the suffering to cease. And one only outgrow the desires,
when they try to kill them. But once we start focusing our energies on the other
spiritual aspect of desires, inherent in us, we will start unraveling other
dimensions of life which brings more peace and understanding to our system. 
</p>

<p>
The karma of a person engrossed in materialistic desires has a huge heap of
impressions of the past collected over time, like - my car, my home, my wife, my
body, my mind, etc. But once we start putting in directed effort on the
spiritual side we see that the even the mind which contains the past karma in
form of memory or impression is actually perverting our view on things. We are
not actually unbiased on things if we are driven by a brain tainted with memories. 
Memory, again, is a good thing to have, but then we must be able to keep it at a
distance when desired. We should be able to make a distance
with whatever is physical! This is what will give us taintless eye on things and
hence a view to see things, the way they are, and not corrupted in any way.

<p>
May the force be with you!
