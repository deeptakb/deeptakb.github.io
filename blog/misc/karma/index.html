Karma is the actions we do. But this is a little more subtle than that. Karma,
in some sense, implies the impressions or impact left on the system performing
the action. The impressions we are talking about are a result of the past action
we have performed. Here, we will discuss as to why should we perform the karma
and how does it leaves us with heaps of impressions. We will also see as what
can be done about it. 
</p>

<p>
We perform a certain karma because we want to do that. Or in other words it is
the desire which drives us to perform a certain karma. We need to dwell in a
further on this desire issue to get a more broader view on the things involved.
Desire is something that makes us do things, takes us to places and defines the
way we are to a great extent. I am not writing this post through some favorite
editor of mine but through the desire to write and communicate with others. So
desires seems like a nice things, which makes us do things which can be helpful
for oneself and others, hopefully! 
</p>

<p>
There are two important aspects to our desires - material and spiritual. 
It is the material desire which
will not satiate and hence we will keep pining for what is not!  This may steal
our 'inner peace' leading us to, erroneously, believe that all sorts of
sufferings find their seeds in desires. Then, one starts desiring that all
desires should go for the suffering to cease. And one only outgrow the desires,
when they try to kill them. But once we start focusing our energies on the other
spiritual aspect of desires, inherent in us, we will start unraveling other
dimensions of life which brings more peace and understanding to our system. 
</p>

<p>
The karma of a person engrossed in materialistic desires has a huge heap of
impressions of the past collected over time, like - my car, my home, my wife, my
body, my mind, etc. But once we start putting in directed effort on the
spiritual side we see that the even the mind which contains the past karma in
form of memory or impression is actually perverting our view on things. We are
not actually unbiased on things if we are driven by a brain tainted with
memories. 
</p>

<p>
Memory, again, is a good thing to have, but then we must be able to keep it a
distance once we are done playing with it. We should be able to make a distance
with whatever is physical! This is what will give us taintless eye on things and
hence a view to see things, the way they are, and not corrupted in any way.
</p>


<p>
May the force be with you!
